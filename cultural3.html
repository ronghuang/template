			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Hearing about more and more news about extraterritorial organisms for several decades, we feel more likely to meet alien friends or enemies in the future. According to truTV, a Brazilian farmer, Antonio Villas Boas, claimed to have been abducted to an egg-shaped UFO forcibly. He also declared that he was forced to have a close encounter with a female alien who was humanoid and has long white hair and blue cat eyes. Many people claimed to have experiences with alien or UFO like Antonio. Maybe they lied about these strange events, but there is some possibility that they are telling the truth. Experiences with alien also attracted governments' attention. Some government started to search about alien, like Soviet Union, China, and the United States. The U.S government just admitted UFOs on September 4th 2013. Robert Jamison, the USAF nuclear missile-targeting officer, declared that he launched some missiles to a UFO after that UPO was reported; Charles Halt, a former air force officer, claimed that in Dec 1980, he saw some high-speed and bright UFOs. He said that these UFOs also scared some residents nearby and he was concerned. Unfortunately, he was not able to figure out what really happened after this event. His boss gave up investigating UFOs. U.S officers’ statement is somehow trustworthy, but the U.S government did not release any official document about extraterritorial organisms. Although governments did not release any documents about extraterritorial organisms because of some reasons, scientists did have some progress on extraterritorial organisms. According to The Telegraph, scientists from the University of Sheffield and Buckingham University have collected fragments of diatom, single celled algae, in the stratosphere. Some experts, however, opposed to this discovery because they believed these diatoms could be carried up to stratosphere by strong storms or some other natural forces. The supporters claimed that: “But it is generally accepted that a particle of the size found cannot be lifted from Earth to heights of, for example, 27km.” All in all, there are more and more alien news bring alien closer to our lives. People started to think more about alien, and wonder about whether alien would come or would alien attack or visit our Earth someday that sort of things. </p>
