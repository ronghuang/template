			<h1>Course Retrospective Project<h1>
			<p>As Broad Business College required, I took Wra 110 course this semester. Personally, I do not enjoy writing. I prefer to talk, instead of writing. It takes me long time to organize my thoughts, and to put my thoughts into words. I, however, actually understand how significant writing skill is. People exchange their idea though papers officially since people can organize their words well in paper in order to make sure those words express their opinions identically as their thoughts. In fact, scholars posted their papers in scholar journals, trade journals to deliver their new research to the world. They barely showed their new research though TV shows or symposium. Anyway, Wra 110 course did help me a lot on improving my writing skill. I learned how to express my habit on my major; I learned how to analyze a movie; I learned how to form a formal research paper; I learned how to create a multimedia remix. </p>
		    <p>Though the Lived Experience Project, I enhanced my resolution of dedicating in Finance major by thinking what specific piece of technology motivated me to choose finance as my major. In this project, I asked myself that what made me decide to major in Finance. The answer is that allocating assets in order to regenerate more assets is extremely attractive to me. I enjoy the feeling of create something simply by reallocate the resource instead of adding resource. Next, I chose stock market as the specific piece of technology that drives me into the world of finance. The main point of this project is to clarify the relation between the piece of technology and the major I chose. So I talked about how I first know stock market, and how it influences my life from then on. I used a great amount of details to describe the story between stock market and me. By showing these stories, the audience would know why stock market, which represents finance, is attractive to me. These details explain how stock market pushes me into the world of finance as well. All in all, in order to write a decent paper for this project, students should first have a desired major and technologies relating to that major, and depict all the detail of how these technologies pushes them to choose their majors. Lastly, do not forget to add your personally feeling in this project, because that is a main part either. The good thing of this project is that it helps you think deeply about why you chose your major, or maybe you would figure out that you actually do not like your chosen major, and you would find out one other major you truly belong to. Every student has to write an essay about why you chose that major before he (she) enters the college of that major. So why don’t you be excited and start to practice?<p>
		    <p>For the Cultural Analysis Proposal, we have to analyze an artifact of popular culture and discuss a social issue it brings out. This proposal was hard for me because it required 1,800 words or more, and I never wrote an essay long like this. I figured that as I fellow the instruction, I successfully wrote a 1,800 words essay. Thus, the key to finish this long essay is to fellow the instruction. More specifically, you should divide your essay into six sections including executive summary, Background analysis (analysis of the artifact), Description of the issue, Proposed solution, Anticipated results/effects, and Conclusion. Once you divide your essay into six sections as the instruction indicated, you will know that you only need to write six short essays, 300 words for each. This will definitely make you feel lots easier. Since this essay required a works cited/references page, I suggest new student to search “APA Citation” in Google, you will find a format of APA Citation and you will learn how to write a citation as the APA instruction shown. In the future of our academic career, we are 100% required to analyze a work, maybe an artifact, a paper, or a book. It would be so much easier for our future if we stated to practice write an analysis from now on. In addition, the instruction of this project shows us a fabulous form of writing an analysis. Put some effort on this project, you will learn a useful writing skill for sure. <p>
		    <p>Formal Research Report is the third project we need to do for this course, which is also the most useful project personally. Formal research report gives students an opportunity to practice writing a paper about an important academic discussion. In order to finish this report successfully, I need to not only fellow the instruction, but also organize my paper well because this paper has to cover various elements like, discussions of a scholarly article and a trade publication, interviews with a professor in the discipline I chose, and graphs, tables from the articles. As the third project we have for this course, the formal research report required at least 2,700 words, it seems a lot, but as I wrote my paper following the instruction, I felt like 2,700 words is moderate for this paper since this paper content huge amount of information. Organizing the paper is the main challenge of this project. I put the graphs or table right after where I discuss about it. That helps audience to view the graph or the table right after they read the related discussion so that they would have a better understanding about what I was talking about above. As a college student, we have to know how to write an excellent formal research report, as I mentioned in the introduction of this paper, we have to use formal research paper to communicate our academics with people. Your talent will be hided if you can not organize an excellent formal research report because no one understand your work. That is why I think this project is the most significant one for us.<p>
		    <p>As the Multimedia Remix Project, we are supposed to create a documentary about a culture issue. The four members in our group have different job, and finally we compose a seven-minute video to show the tea culture. The issue we chose is tea culture. Since college students generally are not familiar with tea culture, I have to add some informative messages when I compose the project. By composing for tea culture, I not only learned more about history of tea, but most importantly, I learned how college students view tea culture. The problems I encounter in organizing and composing my documentary is that some of the history of tea is not qualified since people did not intentionally record the fact about tea culture in the accent society. Audience helps my team know about college students’ view of tea. We select the tea culture topic since we are most interested in this topic, and tea culture is part of Chinese culture. The most challenging part of the project is research on the history of tea as I mentioned above. I did not use systematic approach because my job, which is researching about history of tea, does not need systematic approach. Google scholar is the most beneficial research resource for me in this project. Some credible scholars gave my most of information I need for this project. Wikipedia proved to be the least beneficial because I sometimes found two different historical facts in one issue in this research resource. I am the one who was working on researching, and Yuqing was working on interviewing college students. Next, Yuqing and I provided information we found to two of our team members who are majoring in advertising. Their professional skills help them perfectly composed the documentary. Working in groups definitely made this project fruitful. Everyone has his or her own unique skills, working in groups gave us an opportunity to combine our best skills and compose a fabulous documentary. Additionally, we learned from each other while we were working together. I believe I plan my work in this project well enough. I tried my best to make sure I used credible resource in our project. I will spend more time to make sure the historical facts of tea are credible and find more information about tea culture if I have more time to re do it. The most effective aspect of mu documentary’s design is the map I used to explain the history of tea culture. The visual aid does help audience better understand the development of tea culture. The idea of map came out to me while I was thinking about how could I make the history of tea culture more clear. All in all, the points of this project are an interesting topic, a discovery of the topic, a discussion of the topic, and finally, a creative documentary.<p>
		    <p>The last project we have is the Course Retrospective Project. This project is meant to help new students who are going to take WRA110 success in this course. I reflected how I did on all those previous projects and wrote down my experience. Then James is going to collect works from all members of our team and compose it into a decent essay. Finally, another group will create a website page base on the information we provided. Good luck on Wra110, every one!<p>
