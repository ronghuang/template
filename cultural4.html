			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The main issue of alien is that how might alien affect our lives and how are we going to deal with alien. According to those who claimed to have experiences with aliens, some aliens are friendly to human being, they have civilized communication with human, there is a rumor says that the U.S government have connection with some alien, and the U.S government tried to learn technology from alien; most of aliens are rude to human, they abducted human and used human to do science experiment. One rumor says that a female human got pregnant because of a male alien, and she gave birth to a hybrid child. Of course, that hybrid child was taken care by the government, so no one knows if it was true or what happened next. Alien might be friendly or not. What are we going to do about extraterrestrial organisms if they do exist? Be friends with them? Conquer their territory and colonize their planet if they are weaker than us? Or fight them and protect ourselves if they are stronger than us and trying to conquer the Earth?</p>
