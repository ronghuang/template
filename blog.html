			<h1>Dairy and In-classed Activities</h1>
			<p>Week 1   No class<p>
			<p>Week 2	This is the first time I attended Wra110 course at MSU. I never enjoyed writing; I prefer to talk, instead of writing. It takes me long time to organize my thoughts, and to put my thoughts into words. I, however, actually understand how significant writing skill is. People exchange their idea though papers officially since people can organize their words well in paper in order to make sure those words express their opinions identically as their thoughts. In fact, scholars posted their papers in scholar journals, trade journals to deliver their new research to the world. They barely showed their new research though TV shows or symposium. By the way, Professor Daniels seems like a kind and nice lady. Hope I can learn something from her.</p>
		    <p>Week 3	During this lecture, we learned how to use course website ELI, D2L, Github. These website are all new to me, I feel that they are complicated but I want to know how to use them. We started our first project of the semester, Lived Experiences Project. In this project, I asked myself that what made me decide to major in Finance. The answer is that allocating assets in order to regenerate more assets is extremely attractive to me. I enjoy the feeling of create something simply by reallocate the resource instead of adding resource. Next, I chose stock market as the specific piece of technology that drives me into the world of finance. The main point of this project is to clarify the relation between the piece of technology and the major I chose. So I talked about how I first know stock market, and how it influences my life from then on. I used a great amount of details to describe the story between stock market and me. By showing these stories, the audience would know why stock market, which represents finance, is attractive to me. These details explain how stock market pushes me into the world of finance as well. All in all, in order to write a decent paper for this project, students should first have a desired major and technologies relating to that major, and depict all the detail of how these technologies pushes them to choose their majors. Lastly, do not forget to add your personally feeling in this project, because that is a main part either. Finally, I need to organized my words, and make it a decent essay.<p>
		    <p>Week 4	I finished my final draft for Lived Experience Project this week. Though the Lived Experience Project, I enhanced my resolution of dedicating in Finance major by thinking what specific piece of technology motivated me to choose finance as my major. The good thing of this project is that it helps you think deeply about why you chose your major, or maybe you would figure out that you actually do not like your chosen major, and you would find out one other major you truly belong to. Every student has to write an essay about why you chose that major before he (she) enters the college of that major. So why don’t you be excited and start to practice?<p>
		    <p>Week 5	We have our first In-class activity this week, we watched the video “Televangelist Oral Roberts' gay grandson says "it gets better"”. The basic idea of this video is a gay says how he feels about his uncle treat him unfairly. He is unsatisfied with the fact that his uncle discriminate him because he is a gay. He thinks that he has the right to be gay. The purpose of this video is to confess his true feeling to his uncle. This video attempts achieve its purpose by telling his personal story first, and then express his opinion. By crying, he showed his true feeling about his uncle. He is very sad and angry with the fact that his uncle treated him unfairly. Audience can feel his emotion though the video. So I believe he successfully attempts achieve its purpose. The structure of the message is telling a poem the speaker wrote in ninth grade first, then he tells the story about how his uncle treat him, and finally he talks about his feeling and his opinions. The structure of this video gave me a idea maybe I could use in my Lived Experience Project. Maybe I use write a poem in the beginning of my project. The poem could be related to my story. This must help me attract audience’s attention.<p>
		    <p>Week 6	After the Lived experience project, we are going to start the Cultural Analysis Project. For the Cultural Analysis Proposal, we have to analyze an artifact of popular culture and discuss a social issue it brings out. This proposal was hard for me because it required 1,800 words or more, and I never wrote an essay long like this. I figured that as I fellow the instruction, I successfully wrote a 1,800 words essay. Thus, the key to finish this long essay is to fellow the instruction. More specifically, you should divide your essay into six sections including executive summary, Background analysis (analysis of the artifact), Description of the issue, Proposed solution, Anticipated results/effects, and Conclusion. <p>
		    <p>Week 7	Since we have to include APA format in our project. I learned how to compose APA format this week. I searched “APA format” and read the instruction of how to do the APA citation. We are 100% required to analyze a work, maybe an artifact, a paper, or a book. It would be so much easier for our future if we stated to practice write an analysis from now on. In addition, the instruction of this project shows us a fabulous form of writing an analysis. Put some effort on this project, you will learn a useful writing skill for sure.<p>
		    <p>Week 8	New project for this week, we begin the Formal research Project today. Formal Research Report is the third project we need to do for this course, which is also the most useful project personally. Formal research report gives students an opportunity to practice writing a paper about an important academic discussion. In order to finish this report successfully, I need to not only fellow the instruction, but also organize my paper well because this paper has to cover various elements like, discussions of a scholarly article and a trade publication, interviews with a professor in the discipline I chose, and graphs, tables from the articles. As the third project we have for this course, the formal research report required at least 2,700 words, it seems a lot, but as I wrote my paper following the instruction, I felt like 2,700 words is moderate for this paper since this paper content huge amount of information. Organizing the paper is the main challenge of this project. I put the graphs or table right after where I discuss about it. That helps audience to view the graph or the table right after they read the related discussion so that they would have a better understanding about what I was talking about above.<p>
		    <p>Week 9 We continue working with Formal research project this week, and I read Chapter 5 (Ballenger) and Chapters 19-20(Guide). It was hard to understand this book, but it is helpful. I did learn something from the book. At least, I read faster as I read more and more. As a college student, we have to know how to write an excellent formal research report, as I mentioned in the introduction of this paper, we have to use formal research paper to communicate our academics with people. Your talent will be hided if you can not organize an excellent formal research report because no one understand your work. That is why I think this project is the most significant one for us.<p>
		    <p>Week 10 We watched the film The Social Network in class. It showed me about the history of how Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg created a social network when he was in college. Honestly, I don’t see how Women affect the Tech Industry from this film. The whole movie is about Mark and his colleagues who are also male. The effect of Technology upon Writing and Communication is that Technology promotes communication among people because technology provides a easy and fashion platform for people to communicate. In addition, technology makes people type more and write less since technology replaces traditional writing somehow. Personally, formal education does contribute to Economic and Personal Success in some aspect, but it is not the whole point. Most importantly, people have to have their own unique thought for success.<p>
		    <p>Week 11 We start the Multimodal Remix Project this lecture. Basically, we are going to create a video of a culture issue. It is the first group work in this course, four members of our groups get our individual works, and we combine our works together as a group works. Working in groups definitely made this project fruitful. Everyone has his or her own unique skills, working in groups gave us an opportunity to combine our best skills and compose a fabulous documentary. Additionally, we learned from each other while we were working together.<p>
		    <p>Week 12	This week, we finished the Multimodal Remix Project. I am excited to see our video. Seeing the video we made by ourselves, I feel so satisfied. From this project, I I have to add some informative messages when I compose the project. By composing for tea culture, I not only learned more about history of tea, but most importantly, I learned how college students view tea culture. The problems I encounter in organizing and composing my documentary is that some of the history of tea is not qualified since people did not intentionally record the fact about tea culture in the accent society. Audience helps my team know about college students’ view of tea.<p>
		    <p>Week 13	The last In-classed activity is to discuss the short video Chrysler Eminem Super Bowl Commercial - Imported From Detroit. The imagery of Detroit is a hard-working city. Industries are running every day; people put lots effort on making good stuffs. The background is grey and snowing, that makes Detroit seems serious solemn. I am not going to talk about Inclusion of Eminem/”Lose Yourself” since I don’t really know him and his song. For the Tagline “Imported from Detroit”, I think it make the car more attractive since Detroit is a noble city as we concluded above. The car is more attractive and luxurious since it is imported from Detroit. As the Voiceover, the sound of the voiceover is bass and serious which reflect to the theme of this video, serious and luxurious. All in all, the combination of these three elements, maybe four including the inclusion of Eminem/”Lose Yourself”, makes the people want to purchase the car.<p>
		    <p>Week 14	It is almost the end of this semester; we are going to write a retrospective project for this course. In this project, I talk about my experience on doing every previous project. I believe it will definitely help students who are going to take this course somehow. After I finish the rough draft of this project, I realized that I learned lots writing skills I don’t know before. Now, I know that it was the right choice for me taking WRA 110. The skill I learned in this course will help me success in my future academic career. <p>
		    <p>Week 15	This is the final week for this course, since we have no final exam for this course. We are going to finish the final draft of the retrospective project. As another group work, we are going to create a website page to post our experiences on doing all of our projects. I send my culture analysis experience to James, and he will compose all the pieces from others group member. Finally, there is one group in our class will create a website for our experiences. I can not wait to view the website. Good luck on finals, everyone!!<p>
