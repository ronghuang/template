		<h1>Stock Market and Finance</h1>
		<p>    Stock market is a platform which many companies use to raise funds; the market is a place where people invest to gain profits; this system is a significant part of Finance. I first heard about the stock market when I was in elementary school. I did not understand how stock market worked, but I was interested because whenever my dad talks about it he got excited. I decided to major in finance when I fell in love with stock market several years ago.</p>
	    <p>I developed my interest in stock market when I was a child. My dad invested in stock market about ten years ago, when Chinese economics boomed rapidly. I saw him working in front of the computer screen, and staring at those raising curves which I now know as the tendencies of stocks and mostly green numbers and some red numbers which are actually mean up and down respectively. Sometimes he was happy when curves went up and green numbers showed on the screen, and he would take me to a restaurant. From then on, I realized that the stock market is a fabulous thing, including the curves and the numbers. As I grow up, my family got richer; I knew that stock market played an important role in my life. I started to interest in stock market, and I wanted to know more about it, like how it works and also how dad earned money from it. Asking my dad, I got answers to these questions. My dad told me stock market is a technology using in finance. He taught me lots of things I did not understand as well. What my father told me made me wondered what is Finance. After my dad introduced me the basic rules of stock market, I have a strong feeling of diving into the market. Therefor, I found a stock market game online to play in order to satisfy my curiosity about the market. <p>
	    <p>The game was technically a roles play game. Including a stock market system, this game was attractive to me. The stock market in this game is a brief stock market without that much of elements influencing the prices of stocks. I did not even know what elements affected the prices of stocks in that system. The prices of stocks just went up and down randomly. Sometimes I brought a stock whose price kept decreasing for a long period, like ten minutes. Eventually, the price of that stock bounced, I sold it and I earned a lot from it. Sometimes, I watched the price of a stock went up and up, and I expected it to reach higher. Suddenly, the price of that stock decreased like a falling stone, and I lost some of my capital. In this game, I gained profit form the stock market most of the time, and I could purchase better staffs for my character. Although the profit I gained was not real, I enjoyed the feeling of manipulating capital and investing my capital in different stocks. I guess I like manipulating capital because of one of men’s innate desires, power. <p>
	    <p>My curiosity led me to step into real stock market when I was in junior high as well. I invested in a stock under my dad’s guidance. First, my father showed me the tendency of that stock. The curve of that stock went up and down in a short period, but it went up generally in a long period. Typically, that means this stock tend to rise. Second, according to the research my dad did about the company, which issued the stock, the performance of this company was excellent, it sold for more and more product over last year. Third, the Chinese economics was booming like a rising rocket at this point, many economics policies benefited the company. There were some other reasons indicated this stock was worth to invest. I do not remember all of them. Anyway, I trusted my dad and invest my 1,000 dollars in that stock. I expected that stock to rise so that I would gain profit from it. If it dropped, I would have to found out why it dropped instead of raise as all the evidence indicated. I learned how to analyze a stock. Six months later, this stock I invested raise 20% which also means I earn 20% of my funds, 200 dollars. I was excited because I made money though the stock market. I felt the magic of stock market by my self. On the other hand, stock market sometimes disappoint people by showing lots of declining curves and red numbers. <p>
	    <p>My family suffered from the decline of stock market, over the last couple years. The economics crisis begun in 2008 spread out all over the world and influenced world economics negatively. When investors invest in a stock，the price of this stock goes up because its quantity goes down. Other investors might feel it is a nice idea to invest in this “rising” stock, so they invest more money in it. This virtuous circle make the price of a stock goes up and up, even highly beyond the true value of that stock. This was exactly what happened before the economics crisis, people keep investing in stocks and pushing prices of stocks went up. When prices of stocks went beyond values, someone started to sell, and then the prices dropped, caused more people to sell. The vicious circle drove prices so much lower than values, the stock market crushed. My dad invested in many different stocks which seemed perfect before 2008, the economics crisis. The market crushed in several days, my dad lost much of his money. I have to use less money than before. This event inspired me to think deeper about stock market and finance. What stock market and finance really are? In what way do they impact our lives? How can I manipulate stock market and finance? <p>
	    <p>I did research in Internet about stock market and Finance, and I also took Economics course in high school. I learned more about stock market and Finance in these experiences. I knew more basic knowledge of them. Stock market is a platform where companies raise funds and investors invest. It can be manipulate by huge amount of assets, huge amount assets can decide whether the price of a stock goes up or down. This is also the way some countries or groups use in financial war. Countries and groups attack their targets using financial wars sometimes is more effective than real wars. These new information makes me want to dig deeper about stock market and Finance. <p>
	    <p>The more I know about stock market and Finance, the more problems I do not understand come, like hedge fund, future goods, foreign currency and so on. I am eager to figure these problems out；I am eager to control capital, these are the reasons why I chose to have some fun with Finance. I am going to use four years in university to dig more about stock market and Finance. Stock market is challenging and excited for me. I believe I will be a talented investor in the future. <p>
