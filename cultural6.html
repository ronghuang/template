			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>After a long time, maybe thousands years, alien might come to our Earth. If we have done the three preparations I proposed above perfectly, we will be able to defeat our enemies and protect our Earth if alien is coming to attack the Earth. Or we can move to an earth-like planet and move on our lives. Maybe human can be friend with alien, we can learn from each other and become stronger nations. Our society will not only have three races, but also alien. Maybe we can colonize in other planets if we are stronger than alien we meet. If human have no interaction with alien, at least all the nations in Earth have the same goal and will not fight against each other. Our Earth could be more peaceful. In addition, scientists might find new resources from the universe, which would be helpful to human since we are going to run out of natural resources soon. Finally, we might find a better planet to live on in our universe. There are endless natural resources we could use, as long as we recycle natural resources, we do not need to worry about natural resources in that planet.</p>
