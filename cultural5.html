			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Technology is the main force we could use to counter alien. If alien come to our Earth, no mater why, human has to have power to protect ourselves. Technology is the power we can protect ourselves, or equally communicate with alien, even conquer alien. Here are three directions on what human should spend time on. The first thing we need to do is to prepare a war. We have to prepare for the worst. Human only developed civilization for thousand years and thousand years are nothing in our universe. We are more likely to be the weaker side compare with alien. Since we are the weaker side, it is extremely significant to develop technology and prepare the war against alien. All the nations in our Earth should stop wars to each other and found a global organization preparing war against alien. Trying military, having military exercise as usual, except targets are not other nations in our Earth, but alien. Human develops technology quickly. Humanoid war machine is possible and stronger than human. Human can produce humanoid war machine in order to counter alien. Moreover, human should reinforce our existing weapon, like nuclear weapon. If we can not protect ourselves, no one is going to protect us. If we are weaker than alien, they are not going to negotiate with us or be friends with us because strong race and weak race are not equal. Think about this, human is part of animal, but human is more intelligent than other animals. Human never take animals as friends, we only take animals as pets, food. That is how might alien treat us if we are weaker than alien. The second thing we could do is to do more research on extraterritorial organisms. Government should send more spacecrafts to explore the universe. Staring from our galaxy to farther, spacecrafts could bring samples of other planets so that scientists could discover more about the universe. If scientists make sure alien exist, we should try our best to send our friendly sign to alien because the best way for two nations’ development is learning from each other, instead of fighting each other. I do admit war bring us property, but war do tremendous harms to people’s lives. Further more, we are probably in the weaker side, we might can not win the war if we meet alien. The last thing we should do is to explore our universe and try to find an earth-like planet. This thing can actually do with the second thing, instead of focus on extraterritorial organisms, scientists should also try to find an earth-like planet. The universe is bigger than we thought, there is definitely an earth-like planet that human could live on. Scientists will be able to transform an earth-like planet to a planet we can live on as technology develops rapidly, even better. Once scientists find one, we migrate to our new earth if we meet invincible alien. These three preparations are going to make sure we are ready to meet our alien friends or enemies. </p>
