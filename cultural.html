			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
		    <p>In film Pacific Rim, there are aliens called Kaijus come from the other dimension attack human cities in 2013. When Kaijus first come from the interdimensional portal, they ruin some of cities near coasts. To confront Kaijus, human builds Jaegers, huge humanoid war machines. Jaegers defeat and kill Level one, two and three Kaijus easily. Many fighters feel like fighting Kaijus is just a game, they kill Kaijus and earn honor. They are wrong, however. A Level four Kaiju suddenly emerges in Pacific Ocean and beats a powerful Jaeger controlled by Becket brothers. Raleigh Becket’s brother was killed in the battle, and Raleigh retired. Since no Jaegers can combat Level four Kaijus, most of cities were razed. Safe zones for human are less and less. The government discontinued the Jaegers project and initiated to build coastal walls in order to defend. Breaking coastal walls, Kaijus tell human that defend is not going to work. The former commander of Jaegers, Stacker Pentecost, brings four remaining Jaegers to Hong Kong and develops his force. Stacker intends to destroy the portal using nuclear weapon in order to finish the war. He successfully convinces Raleigh to come back to the Jaegers force. After some training and competition, Mako Mori, a talented Japanese female fighter, become Raleigh’s new partner. Raleigh and Mako are going to control one of four remaining Jaegers. In the meantime, a genius scientist, Newton Geiszler, successfully makes a connection between a fragment of a Kaiju’s brain and his. This two-way connection attracts Kaijus attention, and they attack Hong Kong. Level four Kaijus is powerful and smart, he jeopardizes two remaining Jaegers. By the virtue of this battle, Newton finds a intact brain of a Kaijus. He learns that the portal only allow Kaijus to pass by the last brain connection. Stacker, his co-pilot, Mako, Raleigh and their last two Jaegers battle some Kaijus near the portal. Stacker sacrifices himself and detonates his Jaeger to kill the most formidable Kaiju. Meanwhile, Raleigh catches a Kaiju and jumps into the portal. Finally, Raleigh initiates the nuclear weapon and destroys the portal. The Earth is safe again. There are lots of science fiction films about alien, like Battlefield Earth and Oblivion. So why are science fiction films about alien popular in the last two decade?<p>
