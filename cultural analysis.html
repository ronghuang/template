			<p>I believe many people watched the film Pacific Rim lately. It was cool when I saw Raleigh Becket and his Jaeger drop the nuclear weapon on the portal and finish the war. I feel relax, and I ask myself: why do I feel relax and safe? This is just a film, not realistic. Really? Will aliens come to our Earth and attack human someday in the future? The answer is, probably yes. English scientists have collected some organisms possibly coming from extraterrestrial space. So if alien does exist, what are we going to do with it?</p>
		    <p>In film Pacific Rim, there are aliens called Kaijus come from the other dimension attack human cities in 2013. When Kaijus first come from the interdimensional portal, they ruin some of cities near coasts. To confront Kaijus, human builds Jaegers, huge humanoid war machines. Jaegers defeat and kill Level one, two and three Kaijus easily. Many fighters feel like fighting Kaijus is just a game, they kill Kaijus and earn honor. They are wrong, however. A Level four Kaiju suddenly emerges in Pacific Ocean and beats a powerful Jaeger controlled by Becket brothers. Raleigh Becket’s brother was killed in the battle, and Raleigh retired. Since no Jaegers can combat Level four Kaijus, most of cities were razed. Safe zones for human are less and less. The government discontinued the Jaegers project and initiated to build coastal walls in order to defend. Breaking coastal walls, Kaijus tell human that defend is not going to work. The former commander of Jaegers, Stacker Pentecost, brings four remaining Jaegers to Hong Kong and develops his force. Stacker intends to destroy the portal using nuclear weapon in order to finish the war. He successfully convinces Raleigh to come back to the Jaegers force. After some training and competition, Mako Mori, a talented Japanese female fighter, become Raleigh’s new partner. Raleigh and Mako are going to control one of four remaining Jaegers. In the meantime, a genius scientist, Newton Geiszler, successfully makes a connection between a fragment of a Kaiju’s brain and his. This two-way connection attracts Kaijus attention, and they attack Hong Kong. Level four Kaijus is powerful and smart, he jeopardizes two remaining Jaegers. By the virtue of this battle, Newton finds a intact brain of a Kaijus. He learns that the portal only allow Kaijus to pass by the last brain connection. Stacker, his co-pilot, Mako, Raleigh and their last two Jaegers battle some Kaijus near the portal. Stacker sacrifices himself and detonates his Jaeger to kill the most formidable Kaiju. Meanwhile, Raleigh catches a Kaiju and jumps into the portal. Finally, Raleigh initiates the nuclear weapon and destroys the portal. The Earth is safe again. There are lots of science fiction films about alien, like Battlefield Earth and Oblivion. So why are science fiction films about alien popular in the last two decade?<p>
		    <p>Hearing about more and more news about extraterritorial organisms for several decades, we feel more likely to meet alien friends or enemies in the future. According to truTV, a Brazilian farmer, Antonio Villas Boas, claimed to have been abducted to an egg-shaped UFO forcibly. He also declared that he was forced to have a close encounter with a female alien who was humanoid and has long white hair and blue cat eyes. Many people claimed to have experiences with alien or UFO like Antonio. Maybe they lied about these strange events, but there is some possibility that they are telling the truth. Experiences with alien also attracted governments' attention. Some government started to search about alien, like Soviet Union, China, and the United States. The U.S government just admitted UFOs on September 4th 2013. Robert Jamison, the USAF nuclear missile-targeting officer, declared that he launched some missiles to a UFO after that UPO was reported; Charles Halt, a former air force officer, claimed that in Dec 1980, he saw some high-speed and bright UFOs. He said that these UFOs also scared some residents nearby and he was concerned. Unfortunately, he was not able to figure out what really happened after this event. His boss gave up investigating UFOs. U.S officers’ statement is somehow trustworthy, but the U.S government did not release any official document about extraterritorial organisms. Although governments did not release any documents about extraterritorial organisms because of some reasons, scientists did have some progress on extraterritorial organisms. According to The Telegraph, scientists from the University of Sheffield and Buckingham University have collected fragments of diatom, single celled algae, in the stratosphere. Some experts, however, opposed to this discovery because they believed these diatoms could be carried up to stratosphere by strong storms or some other natural forces. The supporters claimed that: “But it is generally accepted that a particle of the size found cannot be lifted from Earth to heights of, for example, 27km.” All in all, there are more and more alien news bring alien closer to our lives. People started to think more about alien, and wonder about whether alien would come or would alien attack or visit our Earth someday that sort of things. <p>
		    <p>The main issue of alien is that how might alien affect our lives and how are we going to deal with alien. According to those who claimed to have experiences with aliens, some aliens are friendly to human being, they have civilized communication with human, there is a rumor says that the U.S government have connection with some alien, and the U.S government tried to learn technology from alien; most of aliens are rude to human, they abducted human and used human to do science experiment. One rumor says that a female human got pregnant because of a male alien, and she gave birth to a hybrid child. Of course, that hybrid child was taken care by the government, so no one knows if it was true or what happened next. Alien might be friendly or not. What are we going to do about extraterrestrial organisms if they do exist? Be friends with them? Conquer their territory and colonize their planet if they are weaker than us? Or fight them and protect ourselves if they are stronger than us and trying to conquer the Earth? <p>
		    <p>Technology is the main force we could use to counter alien. If alien come to our Earth, no mater why, human has to have power to protect ourselves. Technology is the power we can protect ourselves, or equally communicate with alien, even conquer alien. Here are three directions on what human should spend time on. The first thing we need to do is to prepare a war. We have to prepare for the worst. Human only developed civilization for thousand years and thousand years are nothing in our universe. We are more likely to be the weaker side compare with alien. Since we are the weaker side, it is extremely significant to develop technology and prepare the war against alien. All the nations in our Earth should stop wars to each other and found a global organization preparing war against alien. Trying military, having military exercise as usual, except targets are not other nations in our Earth, but alien. Human develops technology quickly. Humanoid war machine is possible and stronger than human. Human can produce humanoid war machine in order to counter alien. Moreover, human should reinforce our existing weapon, like nuclear weapon. If we can not protect ourselves, no one is going to protect us. If we are weaker than alien, they are not going to negotiate with us or be friends with us because strong race and weak race are not equal. Think about this, human is part of animal, but human is more intelligent than other animals. Human never take animals as friends, we only take animals as pets, food. That is how might alien treat us if we are weaker than alien. The second thing we could do is to do more research on extraterritorial organisms. Government should send more spacecrafts to explore the universe. Staring from our galaxy to farther, spacecrafts could bring samples of other planets so that scientists could discover more about the universe. If scientists make sure alien exist, we should try our best to send our friendly sign to alien because the best way for two nations’ development is learning from each other, instead of fighting each other. I do admit war bring us property, but war do tremendous harms to people’s lives. Further more, we are probably in the weaker side, we might can not win the war if we meet alien. The last thing we should do is to explore our universe and try to find an earth-like planet. This thing can actually do with the second thing, instead of focus on extraterritorial organisms, scientists should also try to find an earth-like planet. The universe is bigger than we thought, there is definitely an earth-like planet that human could live on. Scientists will be able to transform an earth-like planet to a planet we can live on as technology develops rapidly, even better. Once scientists find one, we migrate to our new earth if we meet invincible alien. These three preparations are going to make sure we are ready to meet our alien friends or enemies. <p>
		    <p>After a long time, maybe thousands years, alien might come to our Earth. If we have done the three preparations I proposed above perfectly, we will be able to defeat our enemies and protect our Earth if alien is coming to attack the Earth. Or we can move to an earth-like planet and move on our lives. Maybe human can be friend with alien, we can learn from each other and become stronger nations. Our society will not only have three races, but also alien. Maybe we can colonize in other planets if we are stronger than alien we meet. If human have no interaction with alien, at least all the nations in Earth have the same goal and will not fight against each other. Our Earth could be more peaceful. In addition, scientists might find new resources from the universe, which would be helpful to human since we are going to run out of natural resources soon. Finally, we might find a better planet to live on in our universe. There are endless natural resources we could use, as long as we recycle natural resources, we do not need to worry about natural resources in that planet.<p>
		    <p>Alien may exist. Human might meet alien soon. We have to have the ability to protect ourselves. The only way to strengthen the ability protecting ourselves is to develop technology. As we have enough power to protect ourselves, we will be able to live peacefully with extraterritorial organisms. Maybe someday in the future, we can say hi to an alien friendly and have a nice dinner together.<p>
