Composing in Context The issue I chose is tea culture. Since college students generally are not familiar with tea culture, I have to add some informative messages when I compose the project. By composing for tea culture, I not only learned more about history of tea, but most importantly, I learned how college students view tea culture. The problems I encounter in organizing and composing my documentary is that some of the history of tea is not qualified since people did not intentionally record the fact about tea culture in the accent society. Audience helps my team know about college students’ view of tea.
.</p>
            <p>Process We select the tea culture topic since we are most interested in this topic, and tea culture is part of Chinese culture. The most challenging part of the project is research on the history of tea as I mentioned above. I did not use systematic approach because my job, which is researching about history of tea, does not need systematic approach.<p>
		    <p>Research
Google scholar is the most beneficial research resource for me in this project. Some credible scholars gave my most of information I need for this project. Wikipedia proved to be the least beneficial because I sometimes found two different historical facts in one issue in this research resource.
<p>
		    <p>Collaboration
I am the one who was working on researching, and Yuqing was working on interviewing college students. Next, Yuqing and I provided information we found to two of our team members who are majoring in advertising. Their professional skills help them perfectly composed the documentary. Working in groups definitely made this project fruitful. Everyone has his or her own unique skills, working in groups gave us an opportunity to combine our best skills and compose a fabulous documentary. Additionally, we learned from each other while we were working together.
<p>
		    <p>Project Management
I believe I plan my work in this project well enough. I tried my best to make sure I used credible resource in our project. I will spend more time to make sure the historical facts of tea are credible and find more information about tea culture if I have more time to re do it.
<p>
		    <p>Documentary Design
The most effective aspect of mu documentary’s design is the map I used to explain the history of tea culture. The visual aid does help audience better understand the development of tea culture. The idea of map came out to me while I was thinking about how could I make the history of tea culture more clear.
